		When planning your trip to London, this site may provide you with key information about off the beaten path places to visit whilst there. Hello, my name is Molly Gallagher and when I was 8-years-old, my family moved to London from the US. I have been in love with the city ever since and even had the opportunity to study abroad in London during the spring of 2022. During my spring abroad, my program provided me with an internship and by chance I was placed at a touring company called Totally Tailored! Whilst working there I learned the importance of designing iternaries that matched our clients needs. I learned a bit about the tourist attractions and surrounding areas, too! My overall goal is to communicate useful, reliable information to Americans looking to travel and venture around unique areas of London.
