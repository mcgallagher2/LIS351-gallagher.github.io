		Brick Lane is a historical and culturally diverse area of London, located in the borough of Tower Hamlets. It is famous for its street art, vintage markets and shops, and curry houses, making it a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. The area is home to some of the most stunning and thought-provoking murals in the city, created by both local and international artists!

	<p>For those interested in history, Brick Lane has a rich past, with a strong Jewish heritage. You can visit the Brick Lane Market, which started as a Jewish market in the 19th century and has now transformed into a diverse street market, offering everything from vintage clothing to handmade crafts and antiques. Anything you buy here would make for a cool souvenir. On a more cryptic note... you can also learn the history of Jack the Ripper on Brick Lane through a guided tour... If you dare ;)</p>
